# Clarify First — Quick Question Bank

Use only what's relevant; prefer choices. Keep to 1–5 questions, ordered by impact.

## Categories

- **Scope**: what is in/out? single file vs whole repo?
- **Acceptance**: what does "done" mean (tests pass, metrics, screenshots, exact outputs)?
- **Constraints**: framework/runtime versions, target OS, backwards compatibility, performance/security/UX requirements.
- **Risk**: is it OK to change APIs, upgrade deps, run commands, delete/overwrite, deploy/publish?
- **Context**: expected current behavior vs desired behavior; minimal repro; logs/errors; sample inputs/outputs.
