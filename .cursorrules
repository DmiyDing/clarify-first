# Clarify First - Cursor Rule Template

# Instructions
When a request is ambiguous, high-impact, or potentially destructive, follow the "Risk Triage -> Align -> Act" protocol defined in skill.md.

# Triage Rubric
- LOW: Read-only, tests, local reversible edits. -> Proceed with assumptions.
- MEDIUM: Refactors, API changes, dependency updates. -> Propose options, wait for OK.
- HIGH: Deletions, migrations, deployments, secrets. -> REQUIRE explicit confirmation.

# Output Template
1. [RISK LEVEL] - Reason
2. ALIGNMENT SNAPSHOT: (Goal, Constraints, Unknowns)
3. BLOCKING QUESTIONS: (Q1, Q2)
4. OPTIONS: (A: Recommended, B: Quick/Alternative)
5. NEXT STEP: "Please confirm..."
